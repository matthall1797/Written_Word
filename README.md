### Dissertation
The whole thing, 172 pages on reverse engineering the transcriptional regulatory network of S. pneumoniae to identify antibiotic potentiators. Here we cloned 89 TF-overexpression strains, subjected them to RNAseq and reverse engineered the most comprehensive TRN for S. pneumoniae. We assayed the fitness of each of these strains in response to several antibiotics and abiotic stresses to uncover the interaciton between transcriptome and fitness to find ways to improve antibiotic outcomes.

### The Transcriptional Regulatory Network of Spn
Just a sample of the above.

### Targeting Distinctly Dangerous Subpopulations in Cancer
It seems today the most powerful insights will come from feeding ML models with millions of parameters datasets containing billions of data points. This is a proposal to generate a barcoded Patient-Derived Organoid (PDO) biobank which can generate single-cell leveled data including genotype, epigenotype, transcriptome, treatement and immunotherapy susceptibility profile and metastatic capacity.
